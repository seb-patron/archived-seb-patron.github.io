How do you choose the people that matter in your life? Or better yet, how do you choose who to spend your time with?

For a while, I struggled with this question. It's been said that you are a reflection of the five people you spend most of your time with. I desperately wanted to avoid falling into a trap of surrounding myself with people who didn't believe more was possible.

Initially, I tried to cut these people out of my life. I wanted to only include people in my life who had a similar, growth mindset as me. Friends who strived to achieve more with their lives, and pushed others to do the same. I wanted to be a reflection of friends who were always trying to reach for the best.

I followed this philosophy  until I had a chat with my friend Jose this past weekend. Jose radically changed my perspective on choosing people you spend your time with. Here was Jose's advice:

Instead of cutting people out of your life, create a priority list of the people who matter. At the top, put the people who push you to become a better person. At the bottom, put your old friends who aren't in the same mindset as you.

Then work as hard as you can to never be in the situation that you have to go down the list to the low priority people. If you end up having to hit them up, you know you're not in the place where you're supposed to be. After all, the people you spend your time with are a reflection of yourself, and if you're down to hitting the people who don't want the best for themselves, then maybe you're not striving for the best for yourself.

PS here's an example of some people who push me to strive for better.
