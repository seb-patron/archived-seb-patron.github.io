description: Almond Blossom is life changing
---
This past weekend, I had the opportunity to visit the Vincent Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. The visit was pretty life changing. In fact, I actually fell in love while their. With a painting.

<div class="">
    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/van-gogh/almond-blossom.jpg" alt="" title="Mt. Humphreys, Flagstaff Arizona"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Almond Blossom by Vinvent Van Gogh.
</div>

I may have fallen too in love. Because I ended buying this painting for my dog to wear.

<div class="">
    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/van-gogh/dog-vest.jpg" alt="" title="Mt. Humphreys, Flagstaff Arizona"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Ok more like a dog vest.
</div>

While buying it, I got asked an important question by the cashier:

what kind of dog do you have?
