description: Almond Blossom is life changing
---
This past weekend, I had the opportunity to visit the Vincent Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. The visit was pretty life changing. In fact, I actually fell in love with a painting there.

<div class="">
    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/van-gogh/almond-blossom.jpg" alt="" title="Almond Blossom painting by Vincent Van Gogh"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Almond Blossom by Vincent Van Gogh.
</div>

And by "in love", I really mean obssessed. Really obssessed. So much so, that I bought the painting for my dog to wear. As a vest. Don't ask me why, I'm still trying to figure that out.

Now, I know what you're thinking: Sebastian, on what planet is spending â‚¬40 on a Vincent Van Gogh vest for your dog acceptable? Unfortunately, if I had an answer for you, it would mean I wouldn't have had time to focus on more important problems. Like would my dog actually like the vest I bought him?

No, I don't mean "would he like to wear it?" This is a non issue, Ralphy has already worn sweaters in the past and he never complained. Nor am I asking if it would look good on him. It's impossible for him not to look like a star in a Van Gogh.

The question I'm asking is far deeper than any of these.

Would Ralphy appreciate the genius of Van Gogh? Can Ralphy appreciate art at all? And if not, where can I aquire a dog that can appreciate art while also fitting my Van Gogh vest?

Can you teach a dog to appreciate art?

You're probably wondering why, of all the things to do in Amsterdam, I choose to contemplate if my dog could be taught to appreciate art? For starters, let me show you who Ralphy is:

<div class="">
    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/van-gogh/ralph-the-dog.jpg" alt="" title="Ralph the Dog"/>
</div>

</div>

Ralphy is a Vizsla mix. Basically he's supposed to be a big, bad ass hunting dog from Hungary. Instead genetics decided to screw him over and make him small and fragile. Sounds familiar...

Ralphy is also pretty stupid. This isn't me picking on him, he genuinly is a pretty stupid dog. So you can see where my concerns on whether or not Ralphy even has the capacity to appreciate art started to come from.
