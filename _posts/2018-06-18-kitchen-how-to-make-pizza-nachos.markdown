Greetings family.

Living abroad in Prague has been a fantastic opportunity to immerse myself into the culture and really become appreciative of the differences between the American and Czech lifestyle. The Czech Republic truly has a lot to teach us about living a balanced life.

One area that I have not learned to appreciate is the Czech food. Don't get me wrong, there some fantastic cuisines out here. I have eaten some of the best Indian food I've ever had out here, and the metro pizza isn't bad. It's just not pizza nachos, a staple of every American household?

What's that family? Oh, you wanna know my recipe for my homemade pizza nachos? 

Every family has their own version of a sacred pizza nachos recipe, often handed down from homie to homie. Understand that I mean to show no disrespect when my recipe differs from yours family. Pizza nachos are very subjective, so don't throw hate when mine differ from yours.

## The Ingredients.

Now you already know your boy likes to keep it fresh when he's in the kitchen. Keeping it fresh starts with the base, and most important ingredient, of cooking pizza nachos: the pizza.

Your boy likes to keep it crisp with a thin crust style frozen pizza. While in the Czech Republic, your boy is packing one of these:
<div class="">
    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/pizza-nachos/ristorante-frozen-pizza.jpg" alt="" title="ristorante brand quattro formaggi pizza"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Quattro Formaggi roughly translates into 4 cheese gang in American
</div>

Now your boy doesn't like to call himself an expert without warrant. That said, he's made his fair share of pizza nachos, and in the Czech Republic, Ristorante brand frozen pizza doesn't just keep it fresco: the Quattro Formaggi flavor brings the real flavor town out of the pizza nachos. Ristorante gives max flavor without having to shell out some major dough, and you know your boy is all about conserving his capitol.

With that said, lets hop into the ingredients you'll need fam:

- pizza
- chips
- cheese

In addition, you'll also need an oven. If you don't own one family, don't sweat; other methods of transferring the heat to your pizza can work, but I can't endorse them for safety reasons. Don't say I wasn't watching your back fam.

PS, for the chips, I recommend using traditional corn chips. You can use flour, but if your pizza is meant to bake at high heats for times longer than 8-10 minutes you seriously risk causing some burns on the little homies.

    You wouldn't burn a real homie. Why would you do it to your chip homie then?
</div>

## The cookin.

First, you're gonna wanna flex your pizza out to the shorties. Pull the pie out and lay it on a flat surface. It should look something like this:

<div class="">
    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/pizza-nachos/frozen-pizza.jpg" alt="" title="fresh looking frozen pizza"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Very fresh family.
</div>

Wow family. Just one step in and we already looking :100: :astonished:.

I know  it’s tempting to stop here and just clam down on what we got family. Fight your inner demons family and push on to the next step.

Pull out your chips and sprinkle some onto that pizza you got. You should end up with something like this:

<div class="">
    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/pizza-nachos/chips-on-pizza.jpg" alt="" title="fresh looking frozen pizza with tortilla chips ontop"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Damn family, you just took this sh*t to a whole 'nother level!
</div>

Very clean.

For our next step, get your grater and start shredding some fresh cheese on there. Real G's move in silence like lasagna and use sharp cheddar: it has superior melting qualities that help keep our pizza in one piece. But you know I won't hate on you for using what you're already packing in your fridge.

Now toss that pizza in the oven and bake it according to the instructions on your box. 

Often times, while my pizza is baking, I take the time to sit down and meditate for a bit. Often times, my mind starts to wonder on what my pizza must be thinking. Usually, I begin to focus on this quote from Outkast

<blockquote>
     Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh and clean.
     - Outkast
</blockquote>

Even if its not what my pizza is thinking, I think it's important to stay fresh and clean, so the quote is still relevant.

Ok family, it's been a while; let's take a peek at what we've been cheffing up:

<div class="">
    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/pizza-nachos/in-the-oven.jpg" alt="" title="fresh looking frozen pizza with tortilla chips ontop in the oven"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Yum family.
</div>

This is the part where most of the posers stop to take a pic for the gram and flex on everyone else. I know it’s tempting fam, but fight the urge. We still go more to go.

That's right. We about to go full freak mode family.

You're gonna hop in your flex-mobile and cruise on over to the KFC. Typically, you can catch me up in my Gucci rig when I'm bouta hit the colonel:

<div class="">
    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/pizza-nachos/gucci-mobile.jpg" alt="" title="gucci style fiat"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Real clean family.
</div>

SKKKKKKRRRRT SKKKKKRRRRRRT.

Whoa there family. I know your fiending for those pizza nachos, but remember to obey all local traffic law and wear a seat belt for safety.

When you pull up at the colonel you're gonna order a Deluxe Chicken Strip Box. If the homies ask what sauce you want, be honest and tell them what you want. Never sacrifice  your personal identity just to follow an online pizza nacho recipe family.

Ok, you've got the goodies, but don't rush on back to the crib yet family. We're gonna make a pit stop at the McDonald's and cop us a 8 piece McNugget meal with Fries. Get a large family, and while you're at it, get yourself a soft drink. You deserve it after all the hardwork you've been putting in. I prefer to drink Coke Zero, but that's just because your boy is trying to watch his calorie intake. You do you family.

:warning: Hey family, did you remember to take that za (aka pizza) out of the heat before you left the crib? If not, head back now, or call a love one and ask them to remove the za. :warning:

Ok family, you've pulled off the heist and returned with the goodies. It should all look something like this:

<div class="">
    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/pizza-nachos/the-goodies.jpg" alt="" title="All the food you copped from McDonalds and KFC"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    This heist was so clean you best believe the authorities are gonna be after you family.
</div>

Ok, you may have noticed that there's an extra box of McD's Fries in that pic family :sweat_smile:. Your boy isn't above the temptation to eat a box on the way home. Luckily, he hit the gym hard today, so he can spare the extra calories. He also may have eaten half the KFC fries too. Don't throw shade family, this is a judgement free zone family :no_entry_sign:.

Now, I could write down a detailed set of instructions on how to throw everything on your pizza.

But that just seems excessive. Here's a simplefied version:

1. Throw everything on
2. Cover with cheese

<div class="">
    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/pizza-nachos/final-pre-bake.jpg" alt="" title="A pizza in KFC and fries"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Very clean.
</div>

I know what you're thinking family:

<blockquote>
Damn. I really want to eat this rn.
- you rn (probably)
</blockquote>

### DON'T

We need to throw this big boy into the heat one last time!:fire: :fire: :fire: We want that cheese to be so melted that its wavey. 

If you followed these directions correctly, you should have ended with something like this:

<div class="">
    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/pizza-nachos/finished-pizza.jpg" alt="" title="A tasty American Style Pizza Nacho Pizza"/>

    DISCLAIMER: Your results may vary family.
</div>

Wow. You did it family! And what a very fresh looking pizza! There's only one instruction left:

Enjoy!
