Web development has always been a passion of mine. While I am primarily a backend developer, I have recently begun to branch more into front end development. This blog is an example of some of that work, extended from a jekyll theme! If you want to see a website I designed entirely on my own, check out my projects page at [sebastianpatron.com/projects][projects-site].

I typically work in Ruby on Rails or Node.js with the Express Framework for most of my projects. For front end work, I've been starting to use [tachyons css framework][tachyons] more, although I have done projects with bootstrap 3 and 4.

Below are some sample projects I have done!

Built with Jekyll and based off the al-folio theme. This is my personal website and blog. You can see an example of some of the modifications I did in my [photography page][photography-page], where I wrote a custome script that allows you to click on an image to enlarge it. Go ahead and explore my site's codebase here [github][sebastianpatron-github-io].
