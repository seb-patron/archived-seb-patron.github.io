Machine Learning is one of my passions and sub focuses within data science. I like to spend my free time reading up on new algorithms and practicing my skills on public datasets.

Below are some of my certifications and projecsts I have done within machine learning.

#### Machine Learning by Stanford University Certificate
##### Completed: Monday, July 17, 2017
##### Link: [coursera][neural-networks-deep-learning-certificate]
##### PDF: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/skills/machine-learning/stanford-ml-certificate.pdf">stanford-ml-certificate.pdf</a>
##### Code: [github][stanford-coursera-github]
##### Description:
Stanford's Machine Learning course covers linear regression, logisitic regression, basic neural networks, support vector machines, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and recomender systems. The course is based in matlab, but I also completed some of the assignments in python on my own.


#### Neual Networks and Deep Learning Certificate by Deeplearning.ai
##### Completed: Sunday, September 24, 2017
##### Link: [coursera][stanford-coursera-certificate]
##### PDF: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }} /assets/img/skills/machine-learning/deep-learning-certificate.pdf">deep-learning-certificate.pdf</a>
##### Description: 
Andrew Ng's newest Neural Networks and Deep Learning course covers the basics of implementing a neural network in python and numpy.
