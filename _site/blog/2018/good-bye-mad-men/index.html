<p>37 floors high on the corner of 1271 Avenue of the Americas, New York, a group of powerful men sit around a  mahogany table. Dressed in the most fashionable suits of the era, they’re the ideal of a successful man in the 60’s.</p>

<p>One of them, Don Draper, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj30IBKFK3U">speaks to the group</a>:</p>

<p>He could not be more wrong.</p>

<h4 id="where-did-the-mad-men-go">where did the mad men go?</h4>

<p>The scene above comes from the first episode of Mad Men, a tv show about high flying group of men and their (m)ad agency in the 60s. Back in the day, these men were the ones who created trends, manipulated our psychy, and in the end of it all, made money. Yet, nowadays they are nowhere to be found. What happened to them?</p>

<p>I recently read a fantastic article in the New Yoker titled <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/how-the-math-men-overthrew-the-mad-men?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top&amp;te=1&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;emc=edit_dk_20180521">How the Math Men Overthrew the Mad Men</a> that addresses this exact phenomena. As one of the so called “math men”, I found the article to be incredibly accurate of the current state of advertising.</p>

<p>As the article itself says, “the power of Math Men is awesome”. Today, Facebook and Google each generate more ad dollars than of America’s newpapers combined. While a bit old, the chart below shows just how much these companies have eaten into the old “mad men’s” world of advertising.</p>

<div class="">
    <img class="col three" src="/assets/img/math-men/newpaper-vs-online-ad-world.jpg" />
</div>

<p><br />
For some, these statistics are cause for alarm. I vividly remember sitting in on a lecture from Jonathon Taplin, author of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy</code>, and listening to him argue why the shift of money from newpapers to Google and Facebook is bad.</p>

<p>The reality could not be further from the truth. As someone who works as a data scientist at an ecommerce startup, the rise of Google and Facebook ad systems has been one of the most important disruptions for small businesses since the introduction of the personal computer. The introduction of digital targeted advertising has give small businesses the opportunity to compete and beat out the big guys with all their cash they have to shell out on ads. Digital advertising has leveled out the playing field.</p>

<p>As the New Yorker article correctly points out, every companies’ goal is to reduce risk. By taking advantage of targeted advertising, companies, and in particular small businesses, drastically reduce the risk of wasting their valuable advertising budget by nearly guaranteeing that their ads will be seen by the most relevant audience.</p>

<p>Of course, their are legitimate concerns. Privacy is always a top concern for many people, including myself. For every 10 companies that use our data for valid uses, there’s always that one bad apple that abuses it. And cries for legislation are valid ones: customers have a right to demand their data is not abused.</p>

<p>Whatever happens, it is important to keep in mind just how much better digital advertising has made the internet for all of us. Not only has it helped small businesses, it has also given us incredible resources like Google search and Facebook for free to use. While we should take a closer look at what exactly these companies are doing, let’s not forget the benefits they provide us.</p>

<p>The world is, without a doubt, better with the math men instead of the mad men.</p>
