My name is Sebastian Patron, and I am passionate about data, people, and hip hop music. There is nothing more exciting than using technology and data to help improve our everyday lives. I love wasting my time on worthless thought experiments (like is [Santa in violation of GDPR][featured-blog-post]).

When Iâ€™m not working, you can catch me outdoors kayaking or hiking, reading some classic science fiction, or learning about newest trends in data. I am currently work as a Data Science/Full Stack Engineering Intern at a startup. Most recently, I have been spending my freetime brushing up on my Ruby on Rails skills.

I love meeting new people and learning new things, so please feel free to say hello and send me a <a href="mailto:seb@sebpatron.com?Subject=Hello%20again"> message here</a>! I'm currently a Junior studying at ASU, and I'm always looking for new opportunities.
