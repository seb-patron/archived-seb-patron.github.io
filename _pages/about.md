My name is Sebastian Patron, and I am passionate about data, people, and hip hop music. There is nothing more exciting than using technology and data to help improve our everyday lives. I love thinking up new experiments, and testing them to see if my hypotheses are right.

When Iâ€™m not working, you can catch me outdoors kayaking or hiking, reading some classic science fiction, or learning about newest trends in data. I am currently working towards my Data Engineer Certification from google, and am working on putting together my own machine learning machine. Most recently, I have been brushing up on my Ruby on Rails skills.

I love meeting new people and learning new things, so please feel free to say hello and send me a <a href="mailto:seb@sebpatron.com?Subject=Hello%20again"> message here</a>! I am currently studying in Prague over the summer.
