My name is Sebastian Patron, and I am passionate about data. I firmly believe that the key to unlocking new sources of value for both businesses and individuals lies in the data they possess. In my work as a data scientists I have worked in both for-profit businesses and not-for-profit organizations. 

I spend my free time reading up on the newest data science technologies and learning new skills. I am currently working towards my Data Engineer Certification from google, and am working on putting together my own machine learning machine. I have a side project using predictive systems in combination with Facebook Business to improve ads. 

I love meeting new people and expanding my viewpoints. Currently I am studying in Prague over the summer. If you're interested in discussing data science or any other new technologies, don't hesitate to send me a message and let's get some coffee.
